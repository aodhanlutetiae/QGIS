**Theory**

History: Quantum GIS 1.0 was released in 2009; when version 2.0 was released (in 2013), the name was changed to QGIS.

The following points are introduced:

- Raster v Vector
- Projection
- High / low watermarks
- Filetypes
- SQL, queries and joins

**File types glossary**

- CSV
- DEM (digital elevation models)
- Geojson
- Geopackage
- Geotiff
- Geopandas
- GML
- GPX
- KML & KMZ
- LAS & LAX (lidar)
- OSM
- Shapefile
- Topojson

Glossary
- CRS: Coordinate reference system. It contains:
  - datum or starting point for 0, 0 such as 84 in WGS84
  - projection that converts angles on a round Earth to a flat surface (paper or screen)
- EPSG: Code for a particular CRS. Stands for the now-defunct European Petroleum Survey Group. EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 is the default CRS for QGIS.
- ETRS89: the EU-recommended reference system for geodata in Europe
- GPS: a global positioning system based on a series of satellites since 1978. It uses WGS84
- Mercator: Popular projection by Gerardus Mercator (1569)
- PROJ: files that contain information that defines a CRS
- SRID: Spatial Reference ID
- UTM: Universal Transverse Mercator, a common map projection
- WGS84: World Geodetic System 1984. A widely-used CRS
- WKT (well-known text): a format for defining CRS. Found in .prj files in shapefile folders.

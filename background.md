Web Mercator, called “WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere)” in ArcGIS, and also known as “EPSG: 3857” (European Petroleum Survey Group) and “WGS 84/Popular Visualisation Pseudo-Mercator”, was popularized by Google and has become the most commonly-used coordinate system for web mapping applications. It is currently used by Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Esri ArcGIS Online basemaps, among others.
